Hi! I am Burhanuddin :)
A Computer Engineering student passionate about building stuff!

### introduction

## why are you taking this challenge?

- Looking for job opportunities
- To learn to write production ready code that scales

## something interesting about you?

I can eat whatever i want without gaining a pound

### help I need?

It would be great to have someone to tell me when my code is not production ready or if there is a better way to do something than what i have written
